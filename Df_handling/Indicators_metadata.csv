1,ELECTP_A,0,1,Total electricity output,GWh,wbank_Indic,https://databank.worldbank.org/source/sustainable-energy-for-all#,Total number of GWh generated by all power plants
2,ENECON_A,0,1,Total final energy consumption (TFEC),TJ,wbank_Indic,https://databank.worldbank.org/source/sustainable-energy-for-all#,Derived form energy balances statistics.It is equivalent to total final consumption excluding non-energy use
3,EINT_A,0,1,Energy intensity-primary energy,MJ/2011 USD PPP,wbank_Indic,https://databank.worldbank.org/source/sustainable-energy-for-all#,A ratio between energy supply and gross domestic product measured at purchasing power parity. Energy intensity is an indication of how much energy is used to produce one unit of economic output. A lower ratio indicates that less energy is used to produce one unit of output.
4,RELECTP_A,0,1,Renewable share electricity output,%,wbank_Indic,https://databank.worldbank.org/source/sustainable-energy-for-all#,Electricity generated by power plants using renewable resources as a share of total electricity output.
5,RENECON_A,0,1,Renewable share energy of TFEC,%,wbank_Indic,https://databank.worldbank.org/source/sustainable-energy-for-all#,Share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption
6,RELECTP_B,0,0,Renewable share electricity production,%,edata_share_renew_elec,https://yearbook.enerdata.net/,"Ratio between the electricity production from renewables (hydro, wind, geothermal and solar) and the total electricity production"
7,WPELECTP_B,0,0,Wind and solar share electricity production,%,edata_share_windsolar,https://yearbook.enerdata.net/,Electricity produced from wind and solar energy divided by the total electricity production.
8,ELECTP_B,0,0,Electricity Production,TWh,edata_elec_prod,https://yearbook.enerdata.net/,": Electricity production corresponds to gross production. It includes public production (production of private and public electricity utilities) and industrial producers for their own uses, by any type of power plant (including cogeneration)"
